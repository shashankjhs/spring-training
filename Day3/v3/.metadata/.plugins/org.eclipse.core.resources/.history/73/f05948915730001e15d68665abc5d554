WebApplication is meant for human consumption
WebServices is meant for application consupmtion
The most common format of exchanging data is Json

To Create a web Service in Spring we need to follow below steps :
- Create as new class
- Annotate this class with @RestController
- Define methods in this class, Annotate respective methods with appropriate annotation
- Add Spring Starter web dependency


Monolithic Application:
- it is traditional way of building Application
- If all the funtionalities exist in a single code base then it is called monolithic Applicaiotn
- It is a big single code application
- It is deployed as a single unit

Drawback of monolithic App:
- It become too large in SIze with time
- Even for a small change we need to redeploy the whole application
- Scaling up and Scaling down is difficult with Monolithic




Microservice communication
- Microservice are deployed on separate hardware and it is very common that they want to communicate
- it is typically done using REST call
- Traditionaly REST call can be done by using RestTemplate class given by Spring
- Making REST call Using RestTemplate is error prone, hence we wnat to make REST call easier
- To solve this problem, SpringCloud offers Openfeign
- Openfeign makes REST call Declarative
- Steps to use Openfeign
 1. Add appropiate dependency
